Checkpoint files.
You can break a long pipeline into a series of smaller files using
checkpointing, whose operator is `:`. The idea is to cache intermediate
results. A checkpoint specifies a file and a lambda whose output it should
capture.

defoperator 'checkpoint', q{
  my ($file, $generator) = @_;
  append {-r $file ? cat $file : checkpoint_create $file, $generator};
};

defshort '/:', pmap q{checkpoint $$_[0], $$_[1]}, pseq filename, plambda '';
