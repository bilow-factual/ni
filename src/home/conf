# ni configuration, including CLI option mapping. Uses generators defined in
# meta/ni-option.sh.
#
# Valid argument-parsing syntax specifiers are:
#
#   s   string: rest of short argument, or next whole argument, or lambda
#   v   varstring: one char of short, next whole, or lambda
#   D   as many digits as we have in short mode, next if digits in long mode
#   F   like D, but includes . - (mnemonic float)
#   R   like F, but includes : , (mnemonic range)
#
# D, F, and R are uppercase because they all indicate optional quantities.

# Sorting operations
defoption --group  -g D ni_group
defoption --order  -o D ni_order
defoption --rorder -O D ni_rorder
