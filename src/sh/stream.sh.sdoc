Stream shell functions.
These are called by pipelines to simplify things. For example, a common
operation is to append the output of some data-producing command:

| $ ni . .              # lists current directory twice

If you do this, ni will compile a pipeline that uses stream wrappers to
concatenate the second `ls` output (despite the fact that technically it's a
shell pipe).

append() { cat; "$@"; }
