# ni configuration, including CLI option mapping. Uses generators defined in
# meta/ni-option.sh. Also see ni/ni.sh for the option parsing implementation.
#
# Valid argument-parsing syntax specifiers are:
#
#   s   string: rest of short argument, or next whole argument, or lambda
#   v   varstring: one char of short, next whole, or lambda
#   D   as many digits as we have in short mode, next if digits in long mode
#   F   like D, but includes . - (mnemonic float)
#   R   like F, but includes : , (mnemonic range)
#
# D, F, and R are uppercase because they all indicate optional quantities (i.e.
# they reject any non-numeric argument, leaving that to be interpreted as a
# quasifile or further operator).

# Inference
# ni will infer things about the way in which it tends to be used; for example,
# if you often specify a long filename, it will generate shorthands and let you
# use those instead. This inference is stored in home/inferred and is loaded
# below.
