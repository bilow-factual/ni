Pipeline compiler.
Functions to generate POSIX shell scripts to implement various pipelines.
There are a few things that the compiler is responsible for generating:

| 1. Commands and arguments (i.e. getting shell quoting right)
  2. Heredoc-loaded script interpreters
  3. Temporary files/directories, possibly after invoking a compiler
  4. SSH tunnels to other machines

In other words, this is where everything ni does turns into a real-world
process.
