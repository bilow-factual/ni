# Mixed stdout from parallel processes
This came up while I was writing the simple version of the pipeline-scaling
operator `S`. I expected it to preserve all of the data up to reordering, but
this is what I saw instead:

```sh
$ ni nE6S4pa o,dAc
1       0
1       1
1       0
1       1
1       0
2       1
2       0
4       1
1       0
22      1
1       0
48      1
1       0
156     1
1       0
22      1
1       0
101     1
...
1       13799004
1       1859603
1       32535075
1       1512406657
1       5312963851
1       721435807
1       955013762
1       1229000001
1       210447977942
1       524839496406
```

What's interesting about this is that it isn't a problem with the input we're
sending to each subprocess:

```sh
$ ni nE6S4p'map length, rw {1}' oc
9       1
90      2
900     3
9000    4
90000   5
900000  6
1       7
```

(I ran each of the above commands a number of times; the first was 3/3
erroneous, the second 10/10 correct.)

## Initial guess
It's a loss of `write` atomicity for subprocesses, though I'm not entirely
convinced. POSIX guarantees multiprocess atomicity for anything up to
`PIPE_BUF` bytes (4096 on my system); I modified the perl driver to `syswrite`
each output row (much smaller than 4096) and the problem still happened.

I'll need to merge outputs anyway, though, because we have no guarantee that
lines are shorter than 4KB.

**Update:** Having a separate stdout-merge process fixed it. Still not sure
exactly why, given the short lines.
