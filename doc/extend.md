# Extending ni
You can extend ni by writing a library. For example, suppose we want a new
operator `N` that counts lines by shelling out to `wc -l`:

```bash
$ mkdir my-library
$ echo my-lib.pl > my-library/lib
$ echo "defshort 'root', 'N', k sh ['wc', '-l'];" > my-library/my-lib.pl
$ ni --lib my-library n:100N
100
```
