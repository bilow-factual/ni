# Faceting
ni supports an operator that facets rows: that is, it groups them by some
function and aggregates within each group. How this is implemented depends on
the backend; map/reduce workflows do this automatically with the shuffle step,
whereas multiple POSIX tools are required.

The basic format of the facet operator is like this:

```sh
$ ni ... @<language><key-expr> <reducer>
```

For example, here's a Perl facet to implement word count:

```bash
$ ni @pa 'r a, fc fsum 1' <<'EOF'
foo
bar
foo
bif
EOF
bar	1
bif	1
foo	2
```

Structurally, here's what's going on:

- `@p`: facet with Perl code
- `a`: use the first column value as the faceting key
- `r ...`: make a TSV row from an array of values...
  - `a`: ...the first of which is the faceting key (which is always `a` because
    the facet column is prepended to the data)
  - `fc ...`: return an array of streaming reductions within each facet
    - `fsum 1`: the first (and only) of which is a sum of the constant 1 for
      each reduced item

## Perl
See [perl.md](perl.md) (`ni //help/perl`) for information about the libraries
ni provides for Perl code.

To get a list of users faceted by login shell:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd F::@pg 'r a, @{fc farr B}'
/bin/bash	root
/bin/false	syslog
/bin/sh	backup	bin	daemon	games	gnats	irc	libuuid	list	lp	mail	man	news	nobody	proxy	sys	uucp	www-data
/bin/sync	sync
```

Here, `farr B` means "collect faceted values into an array reference", and in
this case the value is column B. (`B` is in uppercase because `farr` takes a
string argument rather than a code block; this is for performance reasons, and
[perl.md](perl.md) (`ni //help/perl`) discusses the details behind it.)

A lot of faceting workflows can be more easily expressed as a sort/reduce in
code, particularly if you're not computing a new value for the key. For
example, the above query can also be written this way:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd F::gGp'r g, a_ reg'
/bin/bash	root
/bin/false	syslog
/bin/sh	backup	bin	daemon	games	gnats	irc	libuuid	list	lp	mail	man	news	nobody	proxy	sys	uucp	www-data
/bin/sync	sync
```
