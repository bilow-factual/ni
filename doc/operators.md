# Operator reference
**TODO:** Keep the substance here but rewrite it with an awareness that
everything is now parsed/generated by Canard.

Short operators have the following conventions:

- Frequency should be inversely proportional to typing effort on a QWERTY
  keyboard.
- Any operator whose argument is both mandatory and always multi-character can
  be joined with its argument, e.g. `-p'foo'` for Perl code.
- Unlike nfu, each operator is designed to handle a wide variety of use cases
  with optional arguments. This enables better space optimization.
- Lambda arguments are typically coerced, e.g. `-As` to mean `-A ^s`.

## High-level changes from nfu
- ni can compile code in arbitrary languages
- ni saves state by rewriting itself, allowing you to easily customize it
- ni automatically creates shorthands to minimize #characters/operation
- ni is much more concise and has more powerful lambda notation
- Field addressing happens before the operator: `-10f` instead of `-f10`
- Partition is now aggregation: `-Agc` instead of `--partition %0 ^gc`
- Each language supports key-reduction in its API
- Command-line arguments are concatenative: `f1 -g f2` != `f1 f2 -g`
- Quasifiles are read/write

## General-purpose stream operators
The following prefixes are reserved for column addressing:

- `.`: range operator
- `,`: juxtaposition operator; enables field indexes > 9
- `0-9`: fields

Reserved non-operators (i.e. no short or long operator can be one of these, for
syntactic reasons):

Short  | Description
-------|------------
`E`    | exponential indicator: 1E5 = 100000
`=`    | fork stream and save to qfile (with optional lambda transform)
`@`    | fork stream and save to variable (with optional lambda transform)
`:`    | checkpoint through qfile

The following are default bindings and can be changed by modifying `home/conf`:
