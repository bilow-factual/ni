# Libraries
A library is just a directory with a `lib` file in it. `lib` lists the names of
files to be included within that library, one per line, and in doing so
specifies the order of inclusion (which sometimes matters if you're defining
stuff in Perl). Most libraries will include at least one Perl file, which ni
evaluates in the `ni` package. ni will assume that any file ending in `.pl`
should be evaluated when the library is loaded. (Importantly, libraries are
loaded _before_ the main CLI arguments are parsed, which is why it's possible
to add new syntax.)

ni has two library-loading options:

- `ni --lib X ...`: load the `X` library before executing the pipeline
- `ni --extend X [...]`: load the `X` library and rewrite yourself to include
  it in the future (and then execute the pipeline if you got one)

`--extend` is useful in a scripted context when you're building a site-specific
ni executable, e.g.:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
[[ -x /bin/ni ]] || get_ni_from_somewhere
ni --extend site-lib1           # this modifies ni in place
ni --extend site-lib2
```

`--extend` is idempotent, and you can use it to install a newer version of an
already-included library.
