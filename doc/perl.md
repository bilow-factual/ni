# Perl interface
**NOTE:** This documentation covers ni's Perl data transformer, not the
internal libraries you use to extend ni. For the latter, see
[extend.md](extend.md) (`ni //help/extend`).

ni provides the `p` operator to execute a Perl line processor on the current
data stream. For example:

```bash
$ ni n:5p'a * a'                # square some numbers
1
4
9
16
25
```

## Basic stuff
`a` to `q` are one-letter functions that return the first 17 tab-delimited
values from the current line. `r(...)` is a function that takes a list of
values and prints a tab-delimited row. For example:

```bash
$ ni n:4p'r a, a + 1'                   # generate two columns
1	2
2	3
3	4
4	5
$ ni n:4p'r a, a + 1' p'r a + b'        # ... and sum them
3
5
7
9
```

Note that whitespace is required after every `p'code'` operator; otherwise ni
will assume that everything following your quoted code is also Perl.

Internally, `a`, `b`, etc are defined like this, which I explain below:

```pl
sub a() {F_ 0}
sub b() {F_ 1}
...
```

## `F_`: the array of fields
The Perl code given to `p` is invoked on each line of input, which is stored
both in `$l` and, for convenience, in `$_`. ni doesn't split `$l` into fields
until you call `F_`, at which point the split happens and the fields are
cached for efficiency.

`F_(...)` takes one or more column indexes (as zero-based integers) and returns
the field values. If you don't pass in anything, it returns all of the fields
for the line. For example:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3
root	x	0	0	root	/root	/bin/bash
daemon	x	1	1	daemon	/usr/sbin	/bin/sh
bin	x	2	2	bin	/bin	/bin/sh
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3p'r F_ 0..3'
root	x	0	0
daemon	x	1	1
bin	x	2	2
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3p'r scalar F_'            # number of fields
7
7
7
```
