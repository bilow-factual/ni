# Perl interface
**NOTE:** This documentation covers ni's Perl data transformer, not the
internal libraries you use to extend ni. For the latter, see
[extend.md](extend.md) (`ni //help/extend`).

ni provides the `p` operator to execute a Perl line processor on the current
data stream. For example:

```bash
$ ni n:5p'a * a'                # square some numbers
1
4
9
16
25
```

## Basic stuff
`a` to `q` are one-letter functions that return the first 17 tab-delimited
values from the current line. `r(...)` is a function that takes a list of
values and prints a tab-delimited row. For example:

```bash
$ ni n:4p'r a, a + 1'                   # generate two columns
1	2
2	3
3	4
4	5
$ ni n:4p'r a, a + 1' p'r a + b'        # ... and sum them
3
5
7
9
```

Note that whitespace is required after every `p'code'` operator; otherwise ni
will assume that everything following your quoted code is also Perl.

Internally, `a`, `b`, etc are defined like this, which I explain below:

```pl
sub a() {F_ 0}
sub b() {F_ 1}
...
```

### `F_`: the array of fields
The Perl code given to `p` is invoked on each line of input, which is stored
both in `$l` and, for convenience, in `$_`. ni doesn't split `$l` into fields
until you call `F_`, at which point the split happens and the fields are
cached for efficiency.

`F_(...)` takes one or more column indexes (as zero-based integers) and returns
the field values. If you don't pass in anything, it returns all of the fields
for the line. For example:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3
root	x	0	0	root	/root	/bin/bash
daemon	x	1	1	daemon	/usr/sbin	/bin/sh
bin	x	2	2	bin	/bin	/bin/sh
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3p'r F_ 0..3'
root	x	0	0
daemon	x	1	1
bin	x	2	2
$ ni /etc/passwd F::r3p'r scalar F_'            # number of fields
7
7
7
```

### `r`, multiple rows, and return values
`p` executes your Perl code using essentially this template:

```pl
sub row {
  # your code goes here
}
while (<STDIN>) {
  $l = $_;
  print "$_\n" for row();
}
```

Counterintuitively, `r(...)` doesn't return a value; it returns an empty list
and side-effectfully prints a row. It works this way because that allows you to
generate arbitrarily many rows in constant space.

This design is also what makes it possible to omit `r` altogether; then you're
returning one or more values, each of which will become a row of output:

```bash
$ ni n:2p'a, a + 100'                   # return without "r"
1
101
2
102
$ ni n:2p'r a, a + 100'                 # use "r" for side effect, return ()
1	101
2	102
$ ni n:3p'r $_ for 1..a; ()'            # use r imperatively, explicit return
1
1
2
1
2
3
$ ni n:3p'r $_ for 1..a'                # use r imperatively, implicit return
1

1
2

1
2
3

```

The last example has blank lines because Perl's `for` construct returns a
single empty scalar. You can suppress any implicit returns using `;()` at the
end of your mapper code.

Whether you use `r` or implicit returns, ni will remove newlines from every
string you give it. This makes it easier to use `qx` without any filtering.

## Buffered readahead
`p` code can read forwards in the input stream. This is trivially possible by
calling `rl()` ("read line"), which destructively advances to the next line and
returns it; but more likely you'd use one of these instead:

- `@lines = rw {condition}`: read lines while a condition is met
- `@lines = ru {condition}`: read lines until a condition is met
- `@lines = re {a + b}`: read lines while `a + b` is equal

**NOTE:** `rw`, `ru`, and `re` are destructive operators in that they consume
lines and destroy the context for `a`, `b`, etc.

```bash
$ ni n:10p'r ru {a%4 == 0}'             # read forward until a multiple of 4
1	2	3
4	5	6	7
8	9	10
```

The line array returned by `ru` is just an array of flat, tab-delimited strings
(verbatim lines from standard input), but you can extract fields using the
column-accessor functions `a_`, `b_`, etc:

```bash
$ ni n:10p'r map a*$_, 1..10' | tee mult-table
1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
2	4	6	8	10	12	14	16	18	20
3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	27	30
4	8	12	16	20	24	28	32	36	40
5	10	15	20	25	30	35	40	45	50
6	12	18	24	30	36	42	48	54	60
7	14	21	28	35	42	49	56	63	70
8	16	24	32	40	48	56	64	72	80
9	18	27	36	45	54	63	72	81	90
10	20	30	40	50	60	70	80	90	100
$ ni mult-table p'r g_ ru {a%4 == 0}'   # extract seventh column from each line
7	14	21
28	35	42	49
56	63	70
```

`a_` etc are defined like this:

```pl
sub a_ {local $_; map((split /\t/)[0], @_)}
sub b_ {local $_; map((split /\t/)[1], @_)}
...
```

## Utility functions
ni predefines some stuff you may find useful:

- `sum(@)`, `prod(@)`, `mean(@)`
- `max(@)`, `min(@)`, `maxstr(@)`, `minstr(@)`, `argmax(&@)`, `argmin(&@)`
- `any(&@)`, `all(&@)`, `uniq(@)`, `%f = %{freqs(@)}`
- `reduce {f} $init, @xs`
- `reductions {f} $init, @xs`
- `cart([a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], ...) = [a1, b1, ...], [a1, b2, ...], ...`:
  Cartesian product

```bash
$ ni n:100p'sum rw {1}'
5050
$ ni n:10p'prod rw {1}'
3628800
$ ni n:100p'mean rw {1}'
50.5
```

## Streaming lookahead
This is implemented in terms of reducers, and gives you the ability to reduce
arbitrarily many rows in constant space. There are two parts to this. First,
the streaming reduce functions `se` and `sr`; and second, compound reducers
(very useful, and explained in the next section).

### `sr`
Reduces the entire data stream:

```pl
($x, $y, ...) = sr {reducer} $x0, $y0, ...
```

For example, to sum arbitrarily many numbers in constant space:

```bash
$ ni n:10000p'sr {$_[0] + a} 0'
50005000
```

### `se`
Reduces over a contiguous group of rows for which the partition function
remains equal. (Mnemonic is "stream while equal".)

```pl
@final_state = se {reducer} \&partition_fn, @init_state
```

For example, to naively get a comma-delimited list of users by login shell:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd F::gGp'r g, se {"$_[0]," . a} \&g, ""'
/bin/bash	,root
/bin/false	,syslog
/bin/sh	,backup,bin,daemon,games,gnats,irc,libuuid,list,lp,mail,man,news,nobody,proxy,sys,uucp,www-data
/bin/sync	,sync
```

`se` has shorthands for the first 17 columns: `sea`, `seb`, ..., `seq`.

## Compound reducers
If you want to do something like calculating the sum of one column, the average
of another one, and the min/max of a third, you'll end up writing some awkward
reducer code. ni provides a facility called compound reduction to deal with
this. For example, here's the hard way:

```bash
$ ni n:100p'my ($sum, $n, $min, $max) = sr {$_[0] + a, $_[1] + 1,
                                            min($_[2], a), max($_[2], a)}
                                           0, 0, a, a;
            r $sum, $sum / $n, $min, $max'
5050	50.5	1	100
```

And here's the easy way, using `rc`:

```bash
$ ni n:100p'r rc \&sr, rsum A, rmean A, rmin A, rmax A'
5050	50.5	1	100
```

### What's going on here
`rsum`, `rmean`, etc, return compound reducers, which are hash references with
keys that indicate (1) the initial state, (2) the reduction function **as a
string**, and (3) the finalizer (which is why `rmean` can return a single
number despite its intermediate state being the separated sum and number).

Compound reducers are compiled functions, which means their arguments are
expressed as strings representing quoted code. This is why we use `A` rather
than `a` in the example above: `A` evaluates to the string `'a'`, which is
spliced into a function body along with the other reducer expressions and
compiled. The result is a very efficient reducer function that ends up looking
like this:

```pl
sub {($_[0] + a, $_[1] + a, $_[2] + 1, min($_[3], a), max($_[4], a))}
```

`rc` hands this function to `sr` and then uses the finalizer functions to
return individual values, one per initial reducer.

### Custom compound reducers
You can easily create your own compound reducer using `rfn`. For example, let's
count the frequency of each lowercase letter in a file:

```bash
$ ni /etc/passwd FWpsplit// r/[a-z]/ \
     p'my %freqs = %{rc \&sr, rfn q{ ++${%1}{a()} && %1 }, {}};
       map r($_, $freqs{$_}), sort keys %freqs'
a	39
b	36
c	14
d	13
e	17
f	1
g	11
h	20
i	46
k	3
l	19
m	14
n	50
o	25
p	15
r	24
s	51
t	15
u	17
v	12
w	12
x	23
y	12
```

Here's what's going on.
