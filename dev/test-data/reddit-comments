You have just shown that we can do the same for brainfuck + a reasonable preprocessor. Thus my point stands, the discussion is moot as stated.\r\n\r\nHowever. Less is more; to my limited experience, closures compose in substantially more generic and interesting ways than multi-slotted objects. Less is more; closures (if used right) have also the nice property of being immutable, thus one can actually reason about them. Not to mention that the only interesting thing about object theory is subtyping polymorphism, which is a mere crutch. The content of the methods is never proved covariant, not even in theory.

But I have a happy day job using Java/.NET technologies.  I don't tell my co-workers, because they would think I was as crazy as this post says I am.  Why am I learning C?  Why would anyone use C?\n\n1. To better understand how memory is used.  If you saw some of the code I see daily, it's clear that your average coder has no idea, for example, why in Java to use a StringBuffer instead of + for joining strings.\n\n2. Like it or not, it will be around forever.    A friend of mine writes video codecs, entirely in C, then optimizes in assembler.  For this task there's no better tool.  Also, the Linux kernel, and in fact a good part of all Linux programs are written in C.  And, as the poster points out, all language runtimes and OS'es are written in C or C++.\n\n3. Does memory footprint matter?  If virtualization is the future, then memory footprint matters more than ever.  A virtualized server won't have 2G of RAM (no Vista here!), but closer to 128/256M.\n\n4. OOP is not so special that it renders all other technologies obsolete (and this from a Java/.NET programmer!)  Good use of design patterns (Strategy, etc.) often involves replacing inheritance with composition.  In real-life OOP, it's rare to see useful inheritance more than two levels away from Object (outside of maybe UI toolkit code).  Anyway, inheritance can be simulated easily enough in C, for those moments when inheritance would be really helpful.\n\nThat's why I'm learning C.","author":"erikmack","link_id":"t3_5ybcs","score":82}
